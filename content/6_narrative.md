**Ending with the slightly more advanced GH version of CollectionBuilder**, we go through all of the same steps that we did with Sheets but letâ€™s make a mixed media essay the centerpiece of this site.

{% include gallery-figure.html img="config_nav.gif" width="100%" alt="Gif of the action to adjust the config.nav file for a minimal essay layout" caption="How to adjust the config.nav file for a minimal essay layout" %} 

- Adjusting the config.nav file in the **_data** folder, we can remove all of the default pages that we included in the Sheets version of this project and only retain the landing page, the browse page and the About page, which we can rename as Essay. 

{% include gallery-figure.html img="essay_header.gif" width="100%" alt="Gif of the action to change the header material of the About page to Essay" caption="How to change the header material of the About page to Essay" %} 

<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>

- Within this new essay page, we can style our text with [markdown language](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and by incorporating the built-in [Feature Includes](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/pages/features/#feature-includes). These are features stored in the GH template that you can copy and paste onto your markdown pages, as well as guides that show you how to customize them according to your needs. 

{% include gallery-figure.html img="includes_md.jpg" width="100%" alt="Markdown language" caption="Markdown language making up the page presented below" %} 

- Using these includes, we can create **block quotes**, **cards** and **alerts** for readers as well as embed the media around your text as you see fit. When selected, the media goes to an item level view where the reader can learn independently about their content and metadata.

## Conclusion

**I hope this has been an informative**, not *overly technical* overview of the different ways you can understand the same material in different ways using digital scholarship methods. None of the platforms we discussed today are necessarily better or worse than the other, just better suited to making unique insights based on the nature of the research material you are working with.
